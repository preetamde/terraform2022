## PVT - what is it?

1. P stands for provider.tf - here we refer to variables
2. V stands for vars.tf - here we declare variables
3. T stands for terraform.tfvars - here we keep secrets. We must put this file in .gitignore file

### Youtube video trick

For example, if the YouTube link is http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_OBlgSz8sSM

You will have to add _popup word after watch, so that the video opens in full screen without sidebar and comments section. That is, the new video URL is
http://www.youtube.com/watch_popup?v=_OBlgSz8sSM .
