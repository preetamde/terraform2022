There are three folders create as per the tier

1. App
2. DB
3. Web

Database is created and output from this is used into web and app tier using terraform_remote_state function.
Author is using S3 but I hate it. As it is really slow and I want move quickly

Web and App tier folders are not fully build but it should be. Long way to go.
